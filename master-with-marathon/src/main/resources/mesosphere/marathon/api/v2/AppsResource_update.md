## PATCH `/v2/apps/{appId}`

Change parameters of a running application.  The new application parameters
apply only to subsequently created tasks, and currently running tasks are
__not__ pre-emptively restarted.

### Example

**Request:**

```
PUT /v2/apps/myApp HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress
Content-Length: 126
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.7.2

{
    "cmd": "sleep 55", 
    "constraints": [
        [
            "hostname", 
            "UNIQUE", 
            ""
        ]
    ], 
    "cpus": "0.3", 
    "instances": "2", 
    "mem": "9", 
    "ports": [
        9000
    ]
}
```

**Response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Jetty(8.y.z-SNAPSHOT)
```

### Example (version rollback)

If the `version` key is supplied in the JSON body, the rest of the object is ignored.  If the supplied version is known, then the app is updated (a new version is created) with those parameters.  Otherwise, if the supplied version is not known Marathon responds with a 404.
